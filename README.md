In Silico drug discovery is important to find suitable drug targets. The design of these targets is challenging and requires searchable storage to allow identification1. A database can be used to store relevant information about the drugs for future work. Filtering, such as Lipinskiâ€™s rule of five, Bioavailability and Lead-likeness, helps identify targets that fulfil certain practical requirements of drugs. Here, a database was created for a given 100 compounds. These filtering criteria were included to help identify likely drug targets. 

The outline of the program can be simplified as: 
1.	Load the file 
2.	Delete the old database
3.	Calculate the parameters
4.	Create the new database
5.	Populate the database
6.	Apply the filters
7.	Show the database 
8.	Save to file 

A more in depth look at the code (Java) and examples can be seen in Chemical-Database_Report
